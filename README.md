# E-Commerce (Furniture) web application using the MERN stack

This repository has code to create an e-commerce web app that is pre-configured with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, 
React, Node.js). 

By running this code, you'll understand how to:

* Build an application that uses MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js
* Build the front end client side of the application using 'semantic-ui-react' library components that give a sophisticated
  look and feel to the user interface and is very easy to use.
* Build the web applicaiton using Nextjs framework which provides an alternative to create-react-app such as server side 
  rendering and automated api routes.
